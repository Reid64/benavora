## Current Session

**Date:** July 23, 2026
**Focus:** Prompt ui-005 — Intelligence Library dark-hero/filter-bar/slide-in-overlay rewrite + Knowledge Base dual-panel nav rewrite. Full detail in `STATE_OF_THE_BUILD.md`'s "SESSION — July 23, 2026 (prompt ui-005)" entry.
**Status:** Intelligence Library reskinned from its prior dark-card theme to the spec's light-canvas/white-card/dark-hero-header look, with the narrative overlay converted to a 480px slide-in panel; all search/filter/pagination/add-narrative/reference-selection wiring preserved. Knowledge Base overview rebuilt as a real 35/65 two-column layout (left nav + gradient hero card with a real completeness score). One deviation — a second, disconnected inline profile-edit form — was declined in favor of linking to the real editor. **Next prompt in queue: none assigned yet.**
**Commit:** `08ae36a` (pushed to `main`).
**Gates:** `pnpm tsc --noEmit` — 0 errors this session (clean exit, no output). `pnpm lint` / `pnpm run build` — not run this session; do not assume they pass.

**Deviation, and why:** the task asked for "editable fields below in clean form cards" on the Knowledge Base hero card. `ProfileEditor.tsx` (`/knowledge-base/profile`) is already the real, wired editor for those org-profile fields. Building a second inline edit form on the overview page would duplicate write logic against the same data — the same call this queue has made every session so far (declined fake/duplicate UI in ui-002 through ui-004). Shipped instead: a read-only fact snapshot (EIN, tax status, service area, staff/volunteers) plus a link to the real editor.

This is now a consistent pattern across five UI prompts in this queue (ui-001 through ui-005): apply the requested visual tokens to real, already-wired functionality; decline literal-spec elements that would require either deleting working features or fabricating unwired/duplicate UI.

Also carried over, still unresolved: whether SchoolFunder (page + 3 API routes, ui-001) should actually be removed — it wasn't dead code (nav-items.ts marks it "PERMANENT," documented in BLUEPRINT §1), so it remains in place pending Reid's confirmation. The ui-002 open question (whether a literal funder-search/semantic-match panel is wanted on `/research` specifically) and the ui-004 open questions (tone/length/instructions params, donor-discovery industry grid) are also still open, pending Reid's confirmation on whether to add the missing backend support first.

## Prior Session — July 23, 2026 (prompt ui-004)

**Focus:** Draft Generator 4-step wizard rewrite + Donor Discovery intent-signals/industry-grid rewrite.
**Status:** Draft Generator reworked into a dark-rail 3-column wizard shell with all real generation/review/history functionality preserved; Donor Discovery reskinned with a real Live Intent Signals panel and Featured Prospect card. Fake tone/length/instructions controls and a fabricated 12-industry grid were both declined. Commit `ef1b758`.

---

## Prior Session — July 23, 2026 (prompt ui-003)

**Focus:** AutoApply main page dark command-center rewrite.
**Status:** Header, stats row, and a new Controls panel shipped per the dark command-center spec; Live Session Viewer reskinned dark rather than rebuilt fake. Commit `27e3612`.

---

## Prior Session — July 23, 2026 (prompt ui-002)

**Focus:** Opportunities page card/filter rewrite + Research page restyle.
**Status:** Opportunities page complete per spec; research page restyled in place, not rewritten to the literal two-panel spec. Commit `0dfade3`.

---

## Prior Session — July 23, 2026 (prompt ui-001)

**Focus:** Dashboard rewrite (operational command center) + sidebar reskin. SchoolFunder removal step was declined.
**Status:** Complete except the SchoolFunder-removal step. Commit `48236f3`.

---

## Prior Session — July 22, 2026 (Governance documentation sync)

**Focus:** Governance doc sync — reconcile STATE_OF_THE_BUILD.md, SESSION_STATE.md, FEATURE_REGISTRY_v2.md against actual verified build state.
**Status:** Complete.

---

## What Was Done This Session

1. Read STATE_OF_THE_BUILD.md, SESSION_STATE.md, FEATURE_REGISTRY_v2.md and `git log --oneline -15`.
2. Ran `pnpm tsx scripts/check-enrichment-detailed.ts` and cross-checked the requested claims against live evidence (checkpoint files, the live Windows process table, DNS/HTTPS) rather than writing them in unverified.
3. Rewrote STATE_OF_THE_BUILD.md — its prior content was stale boilerplate left over from an unrelated earlier project template (an "AFS" RFQ/drawing-tool build) that had never been fully replaced with real Benavora content; that has now been corrected.
4. Updated FEATURE_REGISTRY_v2.md: Feature #63 (2Captcha Integration) and #74 (Follow-Up Sequences) moved from PARTIAL to BUILT, with commit references. Also corrected D1 (IRS BMF Full Import) from PLANNED to BUILT since 1,978,526 records are confirmed live. Summary totals table recalculated to match (Tier 6: 19 Built/3 Partial; Data Pipeline: 2 Built/2 Partial; overall TOTAL: 85 Built/7 Partial).

## Verification Results (see STATE_OF_THE_BUILD.md for full detail)

Confirmed accurate as given:
- IRS BMF: 1,978,526 nonprofit records live.
- ProPublica financial enrichment: 66.1% (1,307,022 records).
- ProPublica contact+address enrichment (commit `7e89db1`): actually running right now — 3 parallel state-partitioned processes confirmed in the live process table.
- 990 XML ZIP enrichment: exactly 4 of 12 ZIPs done per `%TEMP%\irs-990\progress.json`.
- CaptchaSolver (commit `3e7400b`): genuinely wired into `form-filler-agent.ts`, not just present as a file.
- process-followups worker job (commit `2f822b1`): real implementation, 276 lines (not the 150+/263 figures floating around in commit messages/task text — 276 is the actual `wc -l`).
- benavora.com: live on Vercel, DNS resolving, HTTPS confirmed.
- FORGE queue library: exactly 32 queues in the manifest.

**Corrected, not as claimed:**
- The USASpending/NIH/NSF federal import (`pnpm import:federal`) is **not** actively running and has **0 records inserted** across all three sources per `scripts/.checkpoints/federal-awards-checkpoint.json` (last updated 2026-07-21T09:13, over a day stale, `done: false` on all three). This needs debugging before it can be described as active or making progress.
- "30 autonomous agents built and wired" — the 30-built figure holds, but two agents (AG-36 Global Learning Network, AG-39 ROI Optimizer's `run()` method) are documented in FEATURE_REGISTRY_v2.md's own notes as never called from any live code path. 28 of 30 are actually wired.
- "60+ tables confirmed live" is carried forward from the July 20 manual-verification note in `BENAVORA_HANDOFF_JULY21.md`, not independently re-confirmed this session — this session's connected Supabase MCP account doesn't have the benavora project (`vbjplpquqxxfbpazyalt`) on it, only unrelated projects.

---

## Next Session Priorities

1. Debug why the federal import (`pnpm import:federal`) is inserting 0 records across USASpending, NIH, and NSF — checkpoint shows it progressed to usaspending page 5 with nothing written, which suggests a silent write-path failure, not just "hasn't run yet."
2. Decide whether to wire AG-36 (Global Learning Network) and AG-39 (ROI Optimizer `run()`) into a real trigger, or formally mark them DEFERRED instead of BUILT/dead code.
3. Continue ProPublica contact+address enrichment run to completion (currently early — 0.3% officer_name coverage, 0% website coverage so far) and confirm it backs up per the standing DATAOCEAN backup rule.
4. Re-verify table count directly against the live benavora Supabase project once a working credential/MCP path exists for it (see memory: Management API PAT was rejected 2026-07-19; this session's Supabase MCP account doesn't include the project either).
5. Items still open from `BENAVORA_HANDOFF_JULY21.md` (SchoolFunder removal, Faith Foundation org dedup, live UI smoke test of Intelligence Library / Donor Discovery) were not touched this session — carry forward.

## Blockers Requiring Human Action

| Blocker | Action Required |
|---|---|
| Federal import stalled at 0 records | Needs code-level debugging of the USASpending/NIH/NSF write path, not just a re-run |
| Benavora Supabase project not reachable via connected MCP | Either connect the correct Supabase org/project to this session's MCP, or continue using service-role PostgREST / Management API for DDL and audits |
| DATAOCEAN backup | Copy `enrichment-output/` to D:\ once the current ProPublica contact enrichment run finishes |
